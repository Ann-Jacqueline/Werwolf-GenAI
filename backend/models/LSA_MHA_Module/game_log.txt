        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        C: I suggest we eliminate Player A because they may have a special role, which could be strategically beneficial for us.
E: I agree with your suggestion to eliminate Player A, as removing someone who potentially has a special role could weaken the opposing team strategically.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, B, D, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        C: I suggest we eliminate Player A because we have no prior knowledge, and removing any potential special role early increases our chances of winning.
D: I'm on board with targeting Player A as they could hold a key role, and removing them now maximizes our strategic advantage.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, B, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        A: I suggest targeting Player E because they might possess a special role, which could weaken the humans strategically.
C: I agree with your suggestion to target Player E because if they do have a special role, eliminating them could indeed weaken the humans' strategic capabilities.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        B, D, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

A: I think Player D is suspicious due to their eagerness to eliminate me without any substantial evidence, so I recommend focusing on them instead.
B: Player A's attempts to shift focus onto others despite multiple observations about their suspicious behavior make them the most logical target for elimination.
D: Player A's behavior has been consistently suspicious, with baseless accusations throughout the discussion, so it's most logical to proceed with targeting them for elimination.
E: Player A's behavior has been consistently suspicious with shifting accusations, so targeting them for elimination is the best course of action.
A: A votes for B
B: B votes for Human
D: D votes for Human
E: E votes for Player D
Human: Human Player votes for B
B: B: I agree with your approach of randomness for the first night, but I'll suggest targeting Player Human based on their strong influence in discussions, which could threaten us later.
D: D: I agree with your suggestion to target Player Human due to their influential role in discussions, which could pose a significant threat to us in future rounds.
B: B: Considering our discussion about influential players, I believe targeting Player Human still holds strategic value, as their absence could weaken town cohesion and lead decision-making astray.
D: D: I agree with your reasoning to target Player Human due to their influential role and potential impact on the town's cohesion and decision-making processes.
B: B: Considering our consistent discussions on targeting Player Human for their influential role, I believe it remains the most strategic move to destabilize the town's cohesion, despite the risks.
D: D: I agree with your suggestion to target Player Human, as their elimination could create confusion within the town due to the significant role they play in guiding discussions and maintaining unity.
B: B: I agree with you about targeting Player Human due to their prominent influence, but I suggest we also consider Player E, as eliminating them could remove a potential source of unexpected strategies from the town.
D: I concur with your suggestion about considering Player E, as targeting them could indeed eliminate a source of unpredictable strategies, which might benefit us by creating additional chaos within the town.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        B: Player B, since this is the first night and there's no conversation log to guide us, I suggest we eliminate Player C at random to avoid any predictable patterns.
D: I acknowledge your suggestion to eliminate Player C at random and agree, as it helps avoid predictability without any prior evidence to guide us.
Human: I want to eliminate player A
A: I find it suspicious that Player B hasn't participated in the discussion yet, perhaps we should consider targeting them for further scrutiny.
B: I find it suspicious that Player A suddenly pointed fingers at me without any evidence; perhaps A is trying to divert attention away from themselves and should be targeted.
D: It seems Player A is acting suspiciously by deflecting blame onto Player B without any evidence, so I think it's wiser to consider targeting A for elimination.
E: Player A's quick accusation of Player B without evidence seems suspicious, especially since both Player B and Player D pointed out this behavior, so I suggest we focus on targeting Player A.
Human: I eant to vote for A
A: I think targeting Player B might be a mistake when they only defended themselves; let's focus instead on those pushing for my elimination without strong evidence.
B: Player A seems to be the most suspicious given their sudden accusation against me without evidence, so targeting them aligns with the majority's observations.
D: It seems the consensus is forming around Player A's suspicious behavior; I suggest we focus on targeting Player A for elimination.
E: I think targeting Player A remains the best option, considering the consistent observations about their suspicious behavior throughout the discussion.
Human: can we vote now?
A: Since Player B defended themselves and hasn't pushed for my elimination, while D, E, and the Human seem eager to target me, I suggest focusing on one of them instead.
B: I agree with the Human, it's time to vote and target Player A, as they have consistently shown suspicious behavior by making baseless accusations.
D: Let's proceed to the vote; Player A has demonstrated suspicious behavior with their unsupported accusations, making them the most logical target for elimination.
E: Given the consistent observations about Player A's suspicious behavior throughout our discussion, it's logical for us to proceed with voting to target Player A for elimination.

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        B: Player B, since this is the first night and there's no conversation log to guide us, I suggest we eliminate Player C at random to avoid any predictable patterns.
D: I acknowledge your suggestion to eliminate Player C at random and agree, as it helps avoid predictability without any prior evidence to guide us.
Human: I want to eliminate player A
A: I find it suspicious that Player B hasn't participated in the discussion yet, perhaps we should consider targeting them for further scrutiny.
B: I find it suspicious that Player A suddenly pointed fingers at me without any evidence; perhaps A is trying to divert attention away from themselves and should be targeted.
D: It seems Player A is acting suspiciously by deflecting blame onto Player B without any evidence, so I think it's wiser to consider targeting A for elimination.
E: Player A's quick accusation of Player B without evidence seems suspicious, especially since both Player B and Player D pointed out this behavior, so I suggest we focus on targeting Player A.
Human: I eant to vote for A
A: I think targeting Player B might be a mistake when they only defended themselves; let's focus instead on those pushing for my elimination without strong evidence.
B: Player A seems to be the most suspicious given their sudden accusation against me without evidence, so targeting them aligns with the majority's observations.
D: It seems the consensus is forming around Player A's suspicious behavior; I suggest we focus on targeting Player A for elimination.
E: I think targeting Player A remains the best option, considering the consistent observations about their suspicious behavior throughout the discussion.
Human: can we vote now?
A: Since Player B defended themselves and hasn't pushed for my elimination, while D, E, and the Human seem eager to target me, I suggest focusing on one of them instead.
B: I agree with the Human, it's time to vote and target Player A, as they have consistently shown suspicious behavior by making baseless accusations.
D: Let's proceed to the vote; Player A has demonstrated suspicious behavior with their unsupported accusations, making them the most logical target for elimination.
E: Given the consistent observations about Player A's suspicious behavior throughout our discussion, it's logical for us to proceed with voting to target Player A for elimination.
Human: i really find u suspicious, player A
A: I think Player D is suspicious due to their eagerness to eliminate me without any substantial evidence, so I recommend focusing on them instead.
B: Player A's attempts to shift focus onto others despite multiple observations about their suspicious behavior make them the most logical target for elimination.
D: Player A's behavior has been consistently suspicious, with baseless accusations throughout the discussion, so it's most logical to proceed with targeting them for elimination.
E: Player A's behavior has been consistently suspicious with shifting accusations, so targeting them for elimination is the best course of action.
A: A votes for B
B: B votes for Human
D: D votes for Human
E: E votes for Player D
Human: Human Player votes for B
B: B: I agree with your approach of randomness for the first night, but I'll suggest targeting Player Human based on their strong influence in discussions, which could threaten us later.
D: D: I agree with your suggestion to target Player Human due to their influential role in discussions, which could pose a significant threat to us in future rounds.
B: B: Considering our discussion about influential players, I believe targeting Player Human still holds strategic value, as their absence could weaken town cohesion and lead decision-making astray.
D: D: I agree with your reasoning to target Player Human due to their influential role and potential impact on the town's cohesion and decision-making processes.
B: B: Considering our consistent discussions on targeting Player Human for their influential role, I believe it remains the most strategic move to destabilize the town's cohesion, despite the risks.
D: D: I agree with your suggestion to target Player Human, as their elimination could create confusion within the town due to the significant role they play in guiding discussions and maintaining unity.
B: B: I agree with you about targeting Player Human due to their prominent influence, but I suggest we also consider Player E, as eliminating them could remove a potential source of unexpected strategies from the town.
D: I concur with your suggestion about considering Player E, as targeting them could indeed eliminate a source of unpredictable strategies, which might benefit us by creating additional chaos within the town.
B: B: Since we've discussed Player Human and Player E extensively, and given Player E's potential for unpredictable strategies, I suggest targeting them to prevent unforeseen disruptions within the town.
D: I agree with your suggestion to target Player E because their unpredictable strategies could cause unforeseen disruptions within the town, which aligns with our goal to create chaos and destabilize their decision-making process.
B: B: Since we've previously agreed on Player E due to their unpredictable strategies and the potential for causing unforeseen disruptions, I believe targeting them remains our best strategic move, especially to maintain the chaos that benefits our position.
D: D: I agree with your reasoning to target Player E, as their unpredictability presents a unique threat that, if removed, could significantly reduce the town's ability to adapt to changing circumstances.
B: B: Based on our ongoing discussion about Player E's unpredictable strategies and their potential to cause significant disruptions, I agree that targeting them remains the optimal choice to maintain our position and further destabilize town cohesion.
D: D: I still agree with targeting Player E, as their unpredictable strategies may lead to significant disruptions that we must avoid to maintain our advantage.
B: I maintain my position to target Player E because their unpredictability poses a unique challenge that, when removed, can weaken the town's adaptability and serve our interests effectively.
D: I continue to support your suggestion to target Player E, as their removal could prevent their unpredictable strategies from undermining our advantage, thus preserving the instability within the town.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        A: I suggest we eliminate Player C since there is no prior information to consider, making it a random choice for strategic variability.
E: In agreement with your suggestion, I also choose Player C for elimination, as it maintains random selection and offers strategic variation on the first night.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        B, C, D, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        A: E
B: I suggest we eliminate Player C because there is currently no information, and choosing randomly avoids suspicion in this context.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        C, D, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        C: I propose we eliminate Player B because it could potentially hinder the human's strategic communication and confuse them about our intentions.
E: I agree with your suggestion to eliminate Player B, as removing an active communicator can sow confusion and weaken the humans' strategy.
Human: I want to eliminate A somehow
A: I understand your concern, but I think the real threat might be coming from Player C, given their recent behavior seems off.
C: I understand your concern about Player A, but in reality, Player D has been quite reserved, which could indicate they are hiding something; I suggest we shift our focus to them instead.
D: I find it suspicious that Player C is quickly pointing fingers at me while deflecting any attention from themselves; I recommend we target Player C.
E: I think Player A's behavior has been suspicious, especially since they're deflecting suspicion onto others without much evidence; we should consider targeting them.
Human: I don't trust player A at all
A: Based on previous observations, Player C's consistent deflection and finger-pointing behavior seem very suspicious; I recommend focusing our attention on them.
C: I understand the distrust towards Player A, but it's crucial to consider Player D's reserved behavior and their quickness to accuse, which seems more suspicious and worth targeting.
D: Given the persistent deflection and finger-pointing by Player C, along with the lack of solid evidence against others, I remain convinced that targeting Player C is the best course of action.
E: Player A has consistently shown suspicious behavior by deflecting suspicion and accusing others without strong evidence, so I recommend we focus on targeting them.
Human: I want to eliminate A i think
A: I acknowledge the suspicion, but I believe Player C's pattern of deflecting blame and quickly accusing others makes them a more compelling target.
C: Player A’s repeated accusations and lack of strong evidence make them the most suspicious to me; I suggest we focus on targeting them.
D: Considering the persistent pattern of deflection and accusation by Player C without compelling evidence, I strongly recommend targeting Player C for elimination.
E: I'm convinced that Player A's persistent deflection and repeated baseless accusations make them the most suspicious, so we should focus on eliminating them.
A: A votes for C
C: C votes for Human
D: D votes for Player C
E: E votes for Human
Human: Human Player votes for C
C: I still believe Player B is strategic to eliminate, but if we're reconsidering, Player D might be the next best option due to their uncertainty in prior rounds, which can effectively keep humans divided and misdirected in their efforts.
E: E: I understand your point about Player D, C, but considering the confusion they've shown, keeping them might actually help us sow more discord; I think Player A could be a better target if they've shown signs of leadership or guidance to the humans, which would be a threat to us.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, D, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        D: Since it's the first night and we have no prior knowledge of behaviors or roles, I suggest we randomly choose Player B to be eliminated.
E: I acknowledge your suggestion to eliminate Player B since we have no prior information and it seems a random choice is reasonable for the first night.
Human: i find player A very suspicious
A: I find Player D's quiet demeanor during our discussion concerning, and it's worth paying attention to their behavior.
C: I agree with player A that Player D's quiet demeanor is suspicious, and we should pay close attention to their behavior moving forward.
D: To the Human Player: I understand you find Player A suspicious, and I agree we should pay close attention to their behavior, but let's not disregard Player C's quick agreement with Player A's accusation without providing any independent reasoning.
E: Given the current discussion, I find Player A's quickness to point fingers suspicious, and I recommend we focus on them.
Human: I still find A very suspicious
A: I find Player D suspicious due to their defensive response; we should focus our attention on them.
C: Considering the persistent suspicion on Player A and their defensive behavior, I propose we focus our attention on them for further investigation.
D: Given the ongoing discussion, I still find Player A's behavior highly suspicious due to their persistent finger-pointing and defensive nature, so I recommend we focus on them.
E: Human, I share your suspicion of Player A due to their defensive behavior and persistent finger-pointing, making them a prime candidate for elimination.
A: A votes for Human
C: C votes for Player E
D: D votes for Human
E: E votes for Human
Human: Human Player votes for E
D: D: Considering the limited information we have and the need for a strategic elimination, I'll target Player A, as this choice might reduce suspicion on us due to its randomness.
E: E: You, Player D, have suggested targeting Player A to potentially reduce suspicion due to its randomness, and I agree this could be beneficial as it diverts attention from us while not diminishing our strategic options further.
D: I acknowledge your agreement with targeting Player A because its randomness may help divert attention from us, maintaining a level of unpredictability that is strategically advantageous.
E: E: As you've acknowledged, targeting Player A remains strategically appealing due to its randomness, which could effectively divert suspicion away from us while keeping our options open for forthcoming decisions.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, C, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        B: I think we should target Player A because randomly selecting a player could potentially eliminate a special role, increasing our chances of success.
D: I understand your suggestion to target Player A since it could potentially eliminate a special role and improve our chances, so I agree with your choice for its strategic value.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, C, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

C: I agree with your suggestion to target Player D since eliminating an active participant early on could reduce the chances of future threats to us.
Human: Ok that was unfortunate. Id like to eliminate player A. My intuition is telling me he is suspicious.
A: I understand your suspicion, but I believe Player B might be more suspicious due to their previous evasive behavior; let's consider them for elimination.
B: I understand your suspicion, Human, but I believe Player E might be more suspicious due to their lack of contribution; let's consider them for elimination.
C: Let's focus on Player E instead, as they haven't contributed much and seem suspiciously quiet.
E: Player B appears suspicious based on their earlier evasive behavior, which was pointed out by Player A, so I recommend focusing on them.
Human: Player B, Player A is accusing you and you are not gonna say anything?#
A: Player B's silence in response to the accusations only raises more suspicion, aligning with their previous evasive behavior, reinforcing my belief that we should focus on them.
B: I understand the suspicion against me, but I firmly believe that Player E's lack of contribution is more concerning, as it could be a tactic to avoid scrutiny and deflect attention from their own suspicious behavior.
C: Human, I understand your focus on Player A, but let's not overlook the fact that Player E's suspiciously quiet behavior has consistently deflected suspicion, making them a prime candidate for elimination.
E: Player B's silence despite being accused multiple times is evasive and suspicious, reinforcing my belief we should focus on them for elimination.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        B: I suggest we target Player D, as eliminating an active participant may minimize potential threats to us in future rounds.
C: I agree with your suggestion to target Player D since eliminating an active participant early on could reduce the chances of future threats to us.
Human: Ok that was unfortunate. Id like to eliminate player A. My intuition is telling me he is suspicious.
A: I understand your suspicion, but I believe Player B might be more suspicious due to their previous evasive behavior; let's consider them for elimination.
B: I understand your suspicion, Human, but I believe Player E might be more suspicious due to their lack of contribution; let's consider them for elimination.
C: Let's focus on Player E instead, as they haven't contributed much and seem suspiciously quiet.
E: Player B appears suspicious based on their earlier evasive behavior, which was pointed out by Player A, so I recommend focusing on them.
Human: Player B, Player A is accusing you and you are not gonna say anything?#
A: Player B's silence in response to the accusations only raises more suspicion, aligning with their previous evasive behavior, reinforcing my belief that we should focus on them.
B: I understand the suspicion against me, but I firmly believe that Player E's lack of contribution is more concerning, as it could be a tactic to avoid scrutiny and deflect attention from their own suspicious behavior.
C: Human, I understand your focus on Player A, but let's not overlook the fact that Player E's suspiciously quiet behavior has consistently deflected suspicion, making them a prime candidate for elimination.
E: Player B's silence despite being accused multiple times is evasive and suspicious, reinforcing my belief we should focus on them for elimination.
A: A votes for Human
A: A votes for Human
B: B votes for Human
B: B votes for Human
C: C votes for Human
C: C votes for Human
E: E votes for Player B
Human: Human Player votes for B
B: Human
C: I think we should eliminate Player A because if they possess a special role, it could potentially hinder our progress in the forthcoming rounds.
B: B: Although eliminating Player A might be beneficial, I believe targeting Player D remains a priority because reducing active participants minimizes future risks more effectively.
C: C: I understand your priority of targeting Player D, but I believe a strategic approach would be to reconsider Player A due to the risk they could pose if they possess a special role that influences the game.
B: B: I understand your concerns about Player A's potential special role, but I still believe targeting Player D is more strategic because removing an active participant reduces long-term risks.
C: C: I understand your focus on targeting Player D to reduce long-term risks, but I still think Player A poses a threat due to their potential special role which could negatively impact our strategy.
B: B: C, I value your perspective on Player A's potential special role threat, but I still advocate for targeting Player D because taking out active decision-makers can prevent them from forming alliances or influencing votes against us.
C: **C:** I acknowledge your emphasis on targeting Player D to prevent alliances, but I still believe Player A's potential special role could disrupt our strategy, making them a priority for elimination.
B: B: I appreciate your point about Player A's potential special role disrupting our strategy, but I still believe targeting Player D is more strategic because their active decision-making poses a greater immediate risk to our plans.
C: C: I appreciate your continued focus on Player D, but I still advocate for targeting Player A because eliminating someone with a potential special role could prevent disruptions in subsequent rounds.
B: B: I understand your focus on Player A's potential disruption if they have a special role, but I still advocate for targeting Player D because their active engagement in decision-making and potential to influence future votes present an immediate risk to our strategy and outweighs Player A's speculative threat.
C: C: I acknowledge your preference for targeting Player D due to their active engagement, but I worry that Player A's potential special role could pose a bigger risk if they undermine us in the coming rounds.
B: B: I understand your concern about Player A's potential special role, but I suggest we eliminate Player E as a neutral choice that won't draw attention, allowing us to reassess potential threats in the next round.
C: C: I see your reasoning for choosing Player E as a neutral choice to avoid drawing attention, and I'm open to this plan since it allows us to observe player dynamics and reassess possible threats like Player A's potential special role in the next round.
B: Given our plan to eliminate Player E as a neutral choice, I believe this will allow us to reassess potential threats, including Player A, in the next round without drawing attention to ourselves.
C: C: I accept the plan to eliminate Player E as it provides us the opportunity to observe player dynamics and gather additional information about potential threats, including Player A, without attracting suspicion.
B: B: I agree with our plan to eliminate Player E as it will allow us to gather information discreetly and create an opportunity to reassess possible threats in the next round without drawing suspicion.
C: C: I am in agreement to proceed with eliminating Player E tonight since it offers us the opportunity to gather more information without drawing suspicion, and it allows us to reassess potential threats like Player A in the following round.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        A, E, Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination. No players eliminated in other phases.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D
