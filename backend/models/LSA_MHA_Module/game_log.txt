2025-01-10 13:56:20,723 - INFO - Generated Consensus Prompt:

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        B: I suggest we randomly eliminate Player D to avoid drawing attention to any logical patterns yet.
E: I agree with your suggestion to eliminate Player D tonight because it will create a random pattern that can confuse the villagers about our identities.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        Player A, Player C, Player D, Player Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D
        
2025-01-10 13:56:21,519 - INFO - Final consensus status: Consensus reached on Player D
