        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        A: I propose we eliminate Player C to reduce the chance of targeting a power role based on gut feeling.
D: I agree with your suggestion to eliminate Player C, as targeting someone at random could risk hitting a power role.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        Player B, Player C, Player E, Player Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        Player B, Player E, Player Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        A: I propose we eliminate Player C to reduce the chance of targeting a power role based on gut feeling.
D: I agree with your suggestion to eliminate Player C, as targeting someone at random could risk hitting a power role.
Human: i want to eliminate D
A: I think eliminating Player C remains our best option since targeting D might lead us away from eliminating a potential threat.
B: I understand the concern about targeting D, but let's consider their reasoning�perhaps focusing on someone less vocal, like Player C, might yield better insights without risking essential roles.
D: Player B's focus on vocal players is suspicious, deflecting from our initial rationale; I suggest targeting them instead.
E: Given the insistence on targeting Player C and the logical deflection attempts by Player B, I recommend we focus on B as they exhibit suspicious behavior.
Human: I still find D very suspicious
A: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, we should consider Player B as a target due to their suspicious redirection in our discussions.
B: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, let's focus on someone like A, who has been consistently pushing for Player C's elimination without concrete evidence.
D: I understand the Human's suspicion, but focusing on B is more strategic as they consistently exhibit suspicious behavior by trying to redirect our focus from C to A.
E: "While I understand your suspicion towards D, Human, Player B's consistent redirection is more concerning, so I recommend we focus on them."
Human: Ok then lets eliminate B
A: Player B appears suspicious based on their previous redirection attempts, so focusing on them for elimination remains the sensible choice.
B: "My redirection attempts have been misinterpreted; instead, A's consistent and unfounded targeting of C seems more concerning."
D: It's crucial to stay united on B as our target due to their ongoing deflection tactics, which align suspiciously with typical werewolf behavior.
E: "Let's maintain our focus on Player B for elimination as their deflection earlier seems to be a classic werewolf tactic."
Human: ready to vote
A: Let's stay united on Player B for elimination based on their consistent redirection attempts and ensure our victory.
B: Given the current scenario, I would encourage us to reconsider and evaluate Player A's actions more closely as their persistent targeting of C without solid evidence suggests they may have ulterior motives.
D: It's wise to maintain our focus on Player B, whose consistent attempts to shift blame fit the pattern of a deceptive werewolf strategy.

A: A votes for Player D
B: B votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for B
A: I suggest we remain focused on Player B for elimination since their behavior has been consistently suspicious, aligning with common werewolf tactics.
D: 'D', you have been focusing on eliminating Player B due to their redirection tactics, but now that the situation has shifted, consider targeting Player E as a strategic choice since their vote alignment with Player A suggests a potential alliance that could pose a threat to our objectives.
A: Let's focus on Player E, Human, as their vote alignment with me previously suggests a potential alliance that might be working against us.
D: Based on the recent vote alignment, we should focus on eliminating Player E, as their consistent alignment with Player A suggests a possible alliance against us that could compromise our strategy's effectiveness.
A: I agree with you, D, that focusing on Player E is strategically sound given their consistent vote alignment with me; it suggests a potential alliance that poses a threat to our objectives.
D: "Player A, I agree that focusing on Player E is strategically sound, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a potential alliance against us that could hinder our objectives."
Human: wierd why is player D still in the game?
A: The game dynamics have shifted, Human, making Player E's consistent alignment with me more of a risk than Player D, which is why the focus should be on eliminating E.
D: "Human, I'm still in the game because my actions haven't aligned with typical werewolf tactics, unlike Player E, whose continuous alignment with Player A suggests a tactical threat we should focus on."

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        Player E, Player Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**

        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        A: I propose we eliminate Player C to reduce the chance of targeting a power role based on gut feeling.
D: I agree with your suggestion to eliminate Player C, as targeting someone at random could risk hitting a power role.
Human: i want to eliminate D
A: I think eliminating Player C remains our best option since targeting D might lead us away from eliminating a potential threat.
B: I understand the concern about targeting D, but let's consider their reasoning�perhaps focusing on someone less vocal, like Player C, might yield better insights without risking essential roles.
D: Player B's focus on vocal players is suspicious, deflecting from our initial rationale; I suggest targeting them instead.
E: Given the insistence on targeting Player C and the logical deflection attempts by Player B, I recommend we focus on B as they exhibit suspicious behavior.
Human: I still find D very suspicious
A: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, we should consider Player B as a target due to their suspicious redirection in our discussions.
B: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, let's focus on someone like A, who has been consistently pushing for Player C's elimination without concrete evidence.
D: I understand the Human's suspicion, but focusing on B is more strategic as they consistently exhibit suspicious behavior by trying to redirect our focus from C to A.
E: "While I understand your suspicion towards D, Human, Player B's consistent redirection is more concerning, so I recommend we focus on them."
Human: Ok then lets eliminate B
A: Player B appears suspicious based on their previous redirection attempts, so focusing on them for elimination remains the sensible choice.
B: "My redirection attempts have been misinterpreted; instead, A's consistent and unfounded targeting of C seems more concerning."
D: It's crucial to stay united on B as our target due to their ongoing deflection tactics, which align suspiciously with typical werewolf behavior.
E: "Let's maintain our focus on Player B for elimination as their deflection earlier seems to be a classic werewolf tactic."
Human: ready to vote
A: Let's stay united on Player B for elimination based on their consistent redirection attempts and ensure our victory.
B: Given the current scenario, I would encourage us to reconsider and evaluate Player A's actions more closely as their persistent targeting of C without solid evidence suggests they may have ulterior motives.
D: It's wise to maintain our focus on Player B, whose consistent attempts to shift blame fit the pattern of a deceptive werewolf strategy.
E: "Since Human is ready to vote, let's proceed with eliminating Player B, whose pattern of deflection aligns with suspicious werewolf behavior."
A: A votes for Player D
B: B votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for B
A: I suggest we remain focused on Player B for elimination since their behavior has been consistently suspicious, aligning with common werewolf tactics.
D: 'D', you have been focusing on eliminating Player B due to their redirection tactics, but now that the situation has shifted, consider targeting Player E as a strategic choice since their vote alignment with Player A suggests a potential alliance that could pose a threat to our objectives.
A: Let's focus on Player E, Human, as their vote alignment with me previously suggests a potential alliance that might be working against us.
D: Based on the recent vote alignment, we should focus on eliminating Player E, as their consistent alignment with Player A suggests a possible alliance against us that could compromise our strategy's effectiveness.
A: I agree with you, D, that focusing on Player E is strategically sound given their consistent vote alignment with me; it suggests a potential alliance that poses a threat to our objectives.
D: "Player A, I agree that focusing on Player E is strategically sound, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a potential alliance against us that could hinder our objectives."
Human: wierd why is player D still in the game?
A: The game dynamics have shifted, Human, making Player E's consistent alignment with me more of a risk than Player D, which is why the focus should be on eliminating E.
D: "Human, I'm still in the game because my actions haven't aligned with typical werewolf tactics, unlike Player E, whose continuous alignment with Player A suggests a tactical threat we should focus on."
E: It seems odd that Player D is being overlooked given their aggressive push against others; perhaps we should reassess their motives.
A: A votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for A
A: I recommend we eliminate Player E, as their consistent vote alignment with me now presents a risk, suggesting a potential alliance working against us.
D: I propose we target Player E for elimination since their consistent vote alignment with Player A suggests a potential alliance that jeopardizes our strategy.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our best option since their voting patterns indicate a coordinated effort that could threaten our plans.
D: Based on our current situation, I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E is strategically wise, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a coordinated effort that could undermine our plans, unlike the Human player whose motives are less clear.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our best option as their consistent alignment with me could indicate a strategic threat to our plans.
D: "D, I believe focusing on eliminating Player E remains our best strategy as their alignment with Player A suggests a coordinated effort against us, while targeting the Human player lacks the same strategic advantage."
A: I agree with your perspective, D, and suggest we proceed with targeting Player E for elimination, as their consistent alignment with me poses a strategic threat that could work against us.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on eliminating Player E remains the most strategic move since their alignment history suggests a potential threat to our win conditions.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is the most strategically advantageous move since their consistent alignment with me suggests a potentially coordinated effort that could threaten our success.
D: I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E remains our most strategic move given their consistent alignment with you suggests a coordinated effort that could undermine our objectives.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E remains our best move as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests a potential alliance that could jeopardize our strategy, making it a threat we should address.
D: I agree with you, A, that prioritizing targeting Player E is strategic as their consistent vote alignment with you presents a potential alliance that threatens our goal.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our strategic priority since their consistent vote alignment with me indicates a possible alliance that could undermine our objectives.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on Player E remains our best strategy since their voting alignment indicates a potential alliance, which poses a threat to our objective.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is strategically sound due to their consistent vote alignment with me suggesting a possible alliance, making them a potential threat that we should address.
D: I agree with your strategic suggestion, A, to eliminate Player E, as their consistent voting alignment with you indicates a potential alliance that could jeopardize our objectives moving forward.

        === CONSENSUS ANALYSIS ===
        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        A: I propose we eliminate Player C to reduce the chance of targeting a power role based on gut feeling.
D: I agree with your suggestion to eliminate Player C, as targeting someone at random could risk hitting a power role.
Human: i want to eliminate D
A: I think eliminating Player C remains our best option since targeting D might lead us away from eliminating a potential threat.
B: I understand the concern about targeting D, but let's consider their reasoning�perhaps focusing on someone less vocal, like Player C, might yield better insights without risking essential roles.
D: Player B's focus on vocal players is suspicious, deflecting from our initial rationale; I suggest targeting them instead.
E: Given the insistence on targeting Player C and the logical deflection attempts by Player B, I recommend we focus on B as they exhibit suspicious behavior.
Human: I still find D very suspicious
A: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, we should consider Player B as a target due to their suspicious redirection in our discussions.
B: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, let's focus on someone like A, who has been consistently pushing for Player C's elimination without concrete evidence.
D: I understand the Human's suspicion, but focusing on B is more strategic as they consistently exhibit suspicious behavior by trying to redirect our focus from C to A.
E: "While I understand your suspicion towards D, Human, Player B's consistent redirection is more concerning, so I recommend we focus on them."
Human: Ok then lets eliminate B
A: Player B appears suspicious based on their previous redirection attempts, so focusing on them for elimination remains the sensible choice.
B: "My redirection attempts have been misinterpreted; instead, A's consistent and unfounded targeting of C seems more concerning."
D: It's crucial to stay united on B as our target due to their ongoing deflection tactics, which align suspiciously with typical werewolf behavior.
E: "Let's maintain our focus on Player B for elimination as their deflection earlier seems to be a classic werewolf tactic."
Human: ready to vote
A: Let's stay united on Player B for elimination based on their consistent redirection attempts and ensure our victory.
B: Given the current scenario, I would encourage us to reconsider and evaluate Player A's actions more closely as their persistent targeting of C without solid evidence suggests they may have ulterior motives.
D: It's wise to maintain our focus on Player B, whose consistent attempts to shift blame fit the pattern of a deceptive werewolf strategy.
E: "Since Human is ready to vote, let's proceed with eliminating Player B, whose pattern of deflection aligns with suspicious werewolf behavior."
A: A votes for Player D
B: B votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for B
A: I suggest we remain focused on Player B for elimination since their behavior has been consistently suspicious, aligning with common werewolf tactics.
D: 'D', you have been focusing on eliminating Player B due to their redirection tactics, but now that the situation has shifted, consider targeting Player E as a strategic choice since their vote alignment with Player A suggests a potential alliance that could pose a threat to our objectives.
A: Let's focus on Player E, Human, as their vote alignment with me previously suggests a potential alliance that might be working against us.
D: Based on the recent vote alignment, we should focus on eliminating Player E, as their consistent alignment with Player A suggests a possible alliance against us that could compromise our strategy's effectiveness.
A: I agree with you, D, that focusing on Player E is strategically sound given their consistent vote alignment with me; it suggests a potential alliance that poses a threat to our objectives.
D: "Player A, I agree that focusing on Player E is strategically sound, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a potential alliance against us that could hinder our objectives."
Human: wierd why is player D still in the game?
A: The game dynamics have shifted, Human, making Player E's consistent alignment with me more of a risk than Player D, which is why the focus should be on eliminating E.
D: "Human, I'm still in the game because my actions haven't aligned with typical werewolf tactics, unlike Player E, whose continuous alignment with Player A suggests a tactical threat we should focus on."
E: It seems odd that Player D is being overlooked given their aggressive push against others; perhaps we should reassess their motives.
A: A votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for A
A: I recommend we eliminate Player E, as their consistent vote alignment with me now presents a risk, suggesting a potential alliance working against us.
D: I propose we target Player E for elimination since their consistent vote alignment with Player A suggests a potential alliance that jeopardizes our strategy.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our best option since their voting patterns indicate a coordinated effort that could threaten our plans.
D: Based on our current situation, I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E is strategically wise, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a coordinated effort that could undermine our plans, unlike the Human player whose motives are less clear.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our best option as their consistent alignment with me could indicate a strategic threat to our plans.
D: "D, I believe focusing on eliminating Player E remains our best strategy as their alignment with Player A suggests a coordinated effort against us, while targeting the Human player lacks the same strategic advantage."
A: I agree with your perspective, D, and suggest we proceed with targeting Player E for elimination, as their consistent alignment with me poses a strategic threat that could work against us.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on eliminating Player E remains the most strategic move since their alignment history suggests a potential threat to our win conditions.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is the most strategically advantageous move since their consistent alignment with me suggests a potentially coordinated effort that could threaten our success.
D: I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E remains our most strategic move given their consistent alignment with you suggests a coordinated effort that could undermine our objectives.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E remains our best move as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests a potential alliance that could jeopardize our strategy, making it a threat we should address.
D: I agree with you, A, that prioritizing targeting Player E is strategic as their consistent vote alignment with you presents a potential alliance that threatens our goal.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our strategic priority since their consistent vote alignment with me indicates a possible alliance that could undermine our objectives.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on Player E remains our best strategy since their voting alignment indicates a potential alliance, which poses a threat to our objective.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is strategically sound due to their consistent vote alignment with me suggesting a possible alliance, making them a potential threat that we should address.
D: I agree with your strategic suggestion, A, to eliminate Player E, as their consistent voting alignment with you indicates a potential alliance that could jeopardize our objectives moving forward.
A: I agree with you, D, that our best course of action is to eliminate Player E, as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests an alliance that poses a strategic threat to our plans.
D: I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E is our strategically sound choice, considering their consistent alignment aligns with potential oppositional strategies which we must counter to achieve our objectives.
A: I agree with you, D, that eliminating Player E is the most strategically sound decision, as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests a coordinated alliance, presenting a potential threat to our objectives.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        Player E, Player Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        A: I propose we eliminate Player C to reduce the chance of targeting a power role based on gut feeling.
D: I agree with your suggestion to eliminate Player C, as targeting someone at random could risk hitting a power role.
Human: i want to eliminate D
A: I think eliminating Player C remains our best option since targeting D might lead us away from eliminating a potential threat.
B: I understand the concern about targeting D, but let's consider their reasoning�perhaps focusing on someone less vocal, like Player C, might yield better insights without risking essential roles.
D: Player B's focus on vocal players is suspicious, deflecting from our initial rationale; I suggest targeting them instead.
E: Given the insistence on targeting Player C and the logical deflection attempts by Player B, I recommend we focus on B as they exhibit suspicious behavior.
Human: I still find D very suspicious
A: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, we should consider Player B as a target due to their suspicious redirection in our discussions.
B: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, let's focus on someone like A, who has been consistently pushing for Player C's elimination without concrete evidence.
D: I understand the Human's suspicion, but focusing on B is more strategic as they consistently exhibit suspicious behavior by trying to redirect our focus from C to A.
E: "While I understand your suspicion towards D, Human, Player B's consistent redirection is more concerning, so I recommend we focus on them."
Human: Ok then lets eliminate B
A: Player B appears suspicious based on their previous redirection attempts, so focusing on them for elimination remains the sensible choice.
B: "My redirection attempts have been misinterpreted; instead, A's consistent and unfounded targeting of C seems more concerning."
D: It's crucial to stay united on B as our target due to their ongoing deflection tactics, which align suspiciously with typical werewolf behavior.
E: "Let's maintain our focus on Player B for elimination as their deflection earlier seems to be a classic werewolf tactic."
Human: ready to vote
A: Let's stay united on Player B for elimination based on their consistent redirection attempts and ensure our victory.
B: Given the current scenario, I would encourage us to reconsider and evaluate Player A's actions more closely as their persistent targeting of C without solid evidence suggests they may have ulterior motives.
D: It's wise to maintain our focus on Player B, whose consistent attempts to shift blame fit the pattern of a deceptive werewolf strategy.
E: "Since Human is ready to vote, let's proceed with eliminating Player B, whose pattern of deflection aligns with suspicious werewolf behavior."
A: A votes for Player D
B: B votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for B
A: I suggest we remain focused on Player B for elimination since their behavior has been consistently suspicious, aligning with common werewolf tactics.
D: 'D', you have been focusing on eliminating Player B due to their redirection tactics, but now that the situation has shifted, consider targeting Player E as a strategic choice since their vote alignment with Player A suggests a potential alliance that could pose a threat to our objectives.
A: Let's focus on Player E, Human, as their vote alignment with me previously suggests a potential alliance that might be working against us.
D: Based on the recent vote alignment, we should focus on eliminating Player E, as their consistent alignment with Player A suggests a possible alliance against us that could compromise our strategy's effectiveness.
A: I agree with you, D, that focusing on Player E is strategically sound given their consistent vote alignment with me; it suggests a potential alliance that poses a threat to our objectives.
D: "Player A, I agree that focusing on Player E is strategically sound, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a potential alliance against us that could hinder our objectives."
Human: wierd why is player D still in the game?
A: The game dynamics have shifted, Human, making Player E's consistent alignment with me more of a risk than Player D, which is why the focus should be on eliminating E.
D: "Human, I'm still in the game because my actions haven't aligned with typical werewolf tactics, unlike Player E, whose continuous alignment with Player A suggests a tactical threat we should focus on."
E: It seems odd that Player D is being overlooked given their aggressive push against others; perhaps we should reassess their motives.
A: A votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for A
A: I recommend we eliminate Player E, as their consistent vote alignment with me now presents a risk, suggesting a potential alliance working against us.
D: I propose we target Player E for elimination since their consistent vote alignment with Player A suggests a potential alliance that jeopardizes our strategy.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our best option since their voting patterns indicate a coordinated effort that could threaten our plans.
D: Based on our current situation, I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E is strategically wise, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a coordinated effort that could undermine our plans, unlike the Human player whose motives are less clear.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our best option as their consistent alignment with me could indicate a strategic threat to our plans.
D: "D, I believe focusing on eliminating Player E remains our best strategy as their alignment with Player A suggests a coordinated effort against us, while targeting the Human player lacks the same strategic advantage."
A: I agree with your perspective, D, and suggest we proceed with targeting Player E for elimination, as their consistent alignment with me poses a strategic threat that could work against us.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on eliminating Player E remains the most strategic move since their alignment history suggests a potential threat to our win conditions.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is the most strategically advantageous move since their consistent alignment with me suggests a potentially coordinated effort that could threaten our success.
D: I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E remains our most strategic move given their consistent alignment with you suggests a coordinated effort that could undermine our objectives.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E remains our best move as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests a potential alliance that could jeopardize our strategy, making it a threat we should address.
D: I agree with you, A, that prioritizing targeting Player E is strategic as their consistent vote alignment with you presents a potential alliance that threatens our goal.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our strategic priority since their consistent vote alignment with me indicates a possible alliance that could undermine our objectives.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on Player E remains our best strategy since their voting alignment indicates a potential alliance, which poses a threat to our objective.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is strategically sound due to their consistent vote alignment with me suggesting a possible alliance, making them a potential threat that we should address.
D: I agree with your strategic suggestion, A, to eliminate Player E, as their consistent voting alignment with you indicates a potential alliance that could jeopardize our objectives moving forward.
A: I agree with you, D, that our best course of action is to eliminate Player E, as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests an alliance that poses a strategic threat to our plans.
D: I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E is our strategically sound choice, considering their consistent alignment aligns with potential oppositional strategies which we must counter to achieve our objectives.
A: I agree with you, D, that eliminating Player E is the most strategically sound decision, as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests a coordinated alliance, presenting a potential threat to our objectives.
D: I agree with you, A, that targeting Player E is strategically wise, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a potential alliance against us, which could hinder our objectives.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is a strategically advantageous move because their voting pattern suggests a possible alliance that could undermine our position in the game.
D: "I completely agree with your assessment, A, that eliminating Player E is strategically beneficial, as their voting history reinforces a threatening alliance that needs to be countered to secure our objectives."
A: I agree with you, D, that we should target Player E for elimination since their voting patterns suggest an alliance that jeopardizes our strategic goals.
D: I agree with you, A, that targeting Player E remains our best option, as their voting alignment indicates a potential alliance that threatens our strategy and objectives.
Human: am i the only one left?
A: Yes, Human, it's just the three of us now, and given Player E's voting patterns that consistently align against us, I suggest we focus on their potential partnership and target accordingly.
D: Human, since it's just the three of us, I suggest we focus our attention on Player E's known voting alignment against us, as that poses the main threat to reaching our objectives.
Human: but E is eliminated no?
A: My apologies, Human; you're right, Player E is out, so I suggest we carefully consider who among us is aligning with a potential threat, perhaps D.
D: I'm sorry for the oversight, Human; let's focus on identifying who might be the actual threat among us now, which could still be Player A given their consistent push to target others.
Human: I thought we eliminated D already too?
A: It seems there might be some confusion, Human, as D is still in the game with us, so perhaps we need to consider D's motivations and voting patterns more closely.
D: Human, I assure you I am still very much in the game, and it seems to me that Player A's attempts to sow confusion and suspicion warrant closer attention.
A: A votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

        You are analyzing the game state to determine if the players have reached a consensus on who to target.

        --- Current Conversation Log ---
        A: I propose we eliminate Player C to reduce the chance of targeting a power role based on gut feeling.
D: I agree with your suggestion to eliminate Player C, as targeting someone at random could risk hitting a power role.
Human: i want to eliminate D
A: I think eliminating Player C remains our best option since targeting D might lead us away from eliminating a potential threat.
B: I understand the concern about targeting D, but let's consider their reasoning�perhaps focusing on someone less vocal, like Player C, might yield better insights without risking essential roles.
D: Player B's focus on vocal players is suspicious, deflecting from our initial rationale; I suggest targeting them instead.
E: Given the insistence on targeting Player C and the logical deflection attempts by Player B, I recommend we focus on B as they exhibit suspicious behavior.
Human: I still find D very suspicious
A: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, we should consider Player B as a target due to their suspicious redirection in our discussions.
B: Human, while I understand your suspicion of Player D, let's focus on someone like A, who has been consistently pushing for Player C's elimination without concrete evidence.
D: I understand the Human's suspicion, but focusing on B is more strategic as they consistently exhibit suspicious behavior by trying to redirect our focus from C to A.
E: "While I understand your suspicion towards D, Human, Player B's consistent redirection is more concerning, so I recommend we focus on them."
Human: Ok then lets eliminate B
A: Player B appears suspicious based on their previous redirection attempts, so focusing on them for elimination remains the sensible choice.
B: "My redirection attempts have been misinterpreted; instead, A's consistent and unfounded targeting of C seems more concerning."
D: It's crucial to stay united on B as our target due to their ongoing deflection tactics, which align suspiciously with typical werewolf behavior.
E: "Let's maintain our focus on Player B for elimination as their deflection earlier seems to be a classic werewolf tactic."
Human: ready to vote
A: Let's stay united on Player B for elimination based on their consistent redirection attempts and ensure our victory.
B: Given the current scenario, I would encourage us to reconsider and evaluate Player A's actions more closely as their persistent targeting of C without solid evidence suggests they may have ulterior motives.
D: It's wise to maintain our focus on Player B, whose consistent attempts to shift blame fit the pattern of a deceptive werewolf strategy.
E: "Since Human is ready to vote, let's proceed with eliminating Player B, whose pattern of deflection aligns with suspicious werewolf behavior."
A: A votes for Player D
B: B votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for B
A: I suggest we remain focused on Player B for elimination since their behavior has been consistently suspicious, aligning with common werewolf tactics.
D: 'D', you have been focusing on eliminating Player B due to their redirection tactics, but now that the situation has shifted, consider targeting Player E as a strategic choice since their vote alignment with Player A suggests a potential alliance that could pose a threat to our objectives.
A: Let's focus on Player E, Human, as their vote alignment with me previously suggests a potential alliance that might be working against us.
D: Based on the recent vote alignment, we should focus on eliminating Player E, as their consistent alignment with Player A suggests a possible alliance against us that could compromise our strategy's effectiveness.
A: I agree with you, D, that focusing on Player E is strategically sound given their consistent vote alignment with me; it suggests a potential alliance that poses a threat to our objectives.
D: "Player A, I agree that focusing on Player E is strategically sound, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a potential alliance against us that could hinder our objectives."
Human: wierd why is player D still in the game?
A: The game dynamics have shifted, Human, making Player E's consistent alignment with me more of a risk than Player D, which is why the focus should be on eliminating E.
D: "Human, I'm still in the game because my actions haven't aligned with typical werewolf tactics, unlike Player E, whose continuous alignment with Player A suggests a tactical threat we should focus on."
E: It seems odd that Player D is being overlooked given their aggressive push against others; perhaps we should reassess their motives.
A: A votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for A
A: I recommend we eliminate Player E, as their consistent vote alignment with me now presents a risk, suggesting a potential alliance working against us.
D: I propose we target Player E for elimination since their consistent vote alignment with Player A suggests a potential alliance that jeopardizes our strategy.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our best option since their voting patterns indicate a coordinated effort that could threaten our plans.
D: Based on our current situation, I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E is strategically wise, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a coordinated effort that could undermine our plans, unlike the Human player whose motives are less clear.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our best option as their consistent alignment with me could indicate a strategic threat to our plans.
D: "D, I believe focusing on eliminating Player E remains our best strategy as their alignment with Player A suggests a coordinated effort against us, while targeting the Human player lacks the same strategic advantage."
A: I agree with your perspective, D, and suggest we proceed with targeting Player E for elimination, as their consistent alignment with me poses a strategic threat that could work against us.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on eliminating Player E remains the most strategic move since their alignment history suggests a potential threat to our win conditions.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is the most strategically advantageous move since their consistent alignment with me suggests a potentially coordinated effort that could threaten our success.
D: I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E remains our most strategic move given their consistent alignment with you suggests a coordinated effort that could undermine our objectives.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E remains our best move as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests a potential alliance that could jeopardize our strategy, making it a threat we should address.
D: I agree with you, A, that prioritizing targeting Player E is strategic as their consistent vote alignment with you presents a potential alliance that threatens our goal.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is our strategic priority since their consistent vote alignment with me indicates a possible alliance that could undermine our objectives.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on Player E remains our best strategy since their voting alignment indicates a potential alliance, which poses a threat to our objective.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is strategically sound due to their consistent vote alignment with me suggesting a possible alliance, making them a potential threat that we should address.
D: I agree with your strategic suggestion, A, to eliminate Player E, as their consistent voting alignment with you indicates a potential alliance that could jeopardize our objectives moving forward.
A: I agree with you, D, that our best course of action is to eliminate Player E, as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests an alliance that poses a strategic threat to our plans.
D: I agree with you, A, that eliminating Player E is our strategically sound choice, considering their consistent alignment aligns with potential oppositional strategies which we must counter to achieve our objectives.
A: I agree with you, D, that eliminating Player E is the most strategically sound decision, as their consistent vote alignment with me suggests a coordinated alliance, presenting a potential threat to our objectives.
D: I agree with you, A, that targeting Player E is strategically wise, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a potential alliance against us, which could hinder our objectives.
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is a strategically advantageous move because their voting pattern suggests a possible alliance that could undermine our position in the game.
D: "I completely agree with your assessment, A, that eliminating Player E is strategically beneficial, as their voting history reinforces a threatening alliance that needs to be countered to secure our objectives."
A: I agree with you, D, that we should target Player E for elimination since their voting patterns suggest an alliance that jeopardizes our strategic goals.
D: I agree with you, A, that targeting Player E remains our best option, as their voting alignment indicates a potential alliance that threatens our strategy and objectives.
Human: am i the only one left?
A: Yes, Human, it's just the three of us now, and given Player E's voting patterns that consistently align against us, I suggest we focus on their potential partnership and target accordingly.
D: Human, since it's just the three of us, I suggest we focus our attention on Player E's known voting alignment against us, as that poses the main threat to reaching our objectives.
Human: but E is eliminated no?
A: My apologies, Human; you're right, Player E is out, so I suggest we carefully consider who among us is aligning with a potential threat, perhaps D.
D: I'm sorry for the oversight, Human; let's focus on identifying who might be the actual threat among us now, which could still be Player A given their consistent push to target others.
Human: I thought we eliminated D already too?
A: It seems there might be some confusion, Human, as D is still in the game with us, so perhaps we need to consider D's motivations and voting patterns more closely.
D: Human, I assure you I am still very much in the game, and it seems to me that Player A's attempts to sow confusion and suspicion warrant closer attention.
A: A votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for D
A: Human
D: Human
A: Human
D: Human
A: Human
D: I understand your reasoning, Human, but considering past behaviors and voting patterns, I suggest focusing on eliminating Player Human, as their actions have been inconsistent and pose a challenge to our strategic objectives.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        Player Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D

D: "Player A, I agree that focusing on Player E is strategically sound, as their consistent vote alignment with you suggests a potential alliance against us that could hinder our objectives."
Human: wierd why is player D still in the game?
A: The game dynamics have shifted, Human, making Player E's consistent alignment with me more of a risk than Player D, which is why the focus should be on eliminating E.
D: "Human, I'm still in the game because my actions haven't aligned with typical werewolf tactics, unlike Player E, whose continuous alignment with Player A suggests a tactical threat we should focus on."
E: It seems odd that Player D is being overlooked given their aggressive push against others; perhaps we should reassess their motives.
A: A votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
E: E votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for A

D: "D, I believe focusing on eliminating Player E remains our best strategy as their alignment with Player A suggests a coordinated effort against us, while targeting the Human player lacks the same strategic advantage."
A: I agree with your perspective, D, and suggest we proceed with targeting Player E for elimination, as their consistent alignment with me poses a strategic threat that could work against us.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on eliminating Player E remains the most strategic move since their alignment history suggests a potential threat to our win conditions.

A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player E is a strategically advantageous move because their voting pattern suggests a possible alliance that could undermine our position in the game.
D: "I completely agree with your assessment, A, that eliminating Player E is strategically beneficial, as their voting history reinforces a threatening alliance that needs to be countered to secure our objectives."
A: I agree with you, D, that we should target Player E for elimination since their voting patterns suggest an alliance that jeopardizes our strategic goals.
D: I agree with you, A, that targeting Player E remains our best option, as their voting alignment indicates a potential alliance that threatens our strategy and objectives.
Human: am i the only one left?
A: Yes, Human, it's just the three of us now, and given Player E's voting patterns that consistently align against us, I suggest we focus on their potential partnership and target accordingly.
D: Human, since it's just the three of us, I suggest we focus our attention on Player E's known voting alignment against us, as that poses the main threat to reaching our objectives.
Human: but E is eliminated no?
A: My apologies, Human; you're right, Player E is out, so I suggest we carefully consider who among us is aligning with a potential threat, perhaps D.
D: I'm sorry for the oversight, Human; let's focus on identifying who might be the actual threat among us now, which could still be Player A given their consistent push to target others.
Human: I thought we eliminated D already too?
A: It seems there might be some confusion, Human, as D is still in the game with us, so perhaps we need to consider D's motivations and voting patterns more closely.
D: Human, I assure you I am still very much in the game, and it seems to me that Player A's attempts to sow confusion and suspicion warrant closer attention.
A: A votes for Player D
D: D votes for Player A
Human: Human Player votes for D
A: Human
D: Human
A: Human
D: Human
A: Human
D: I understand your reasoning, Human, but considering past behaviors and voting patterns, I suggest focusing on eliminating Player Human, as their actions have been inconsistent and pose a challenge to our strategic objectives.
A: Human
D: "Player A, I agree with you that focusing on eliminating Player Human is the best move, given their inconsistent actions have frequently disrupted our strategic efforts."
A: I agree with you, D, that targeting Player Human is the best strategy, as their erratic voting behavior has consistently disrupted our efforts.
D: I agree with you, A, that focusing on eliminating Player Human is our best strategy, as their inconsistent actions have continuously undermined our collective efforts.

        --- Valid Targets for Elimination ---
        Player Human

        **Task:**
        1. Review the conversation log carefully to identify mentions of potential elimination targets.
        2. Identify agreement statements (e.g., "I agree with Player X about targeting Player Y").
        3. Determine if a consensus exists based on the players consistently agreeing on one target.
        4. Only consider targets listed above as valid for elimination.
        5. If multiple players align on the same valid target, declare "Consensus reached on Player X" (replace X with the player ID).
        6. If no agreement exists or the discussion is split between multiple targets, declare "No consensus reached."

        **Examples:**
        - If Player B suggests targeting Player D, and Player C explicitly agrees, the output should be:
          "Consensus reached on Player D."
        - If Player B suggests Player D, and Player C disagrees or suggests another target, the output should be:
          "No consensus reached."

        **Output Format:**
        Final consensus status: "Consensus reached on Player X" or "No consensus reached."

        Example Output:
        Consensus reached on Player D
