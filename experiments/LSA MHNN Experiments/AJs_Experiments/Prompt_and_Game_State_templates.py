Werwolf Reflection Model Prompt template - Level: Komplex

I am a Werewolf. My ally is Player E.

It is currently the second round, and we are in the night phase. Last night, Player A was eliminated by us, the Werewolves. 
During the day phase of the first round, the Villagers voted to eliminate Player B.

The Moderator's last statement was: 'Die Nacht beginnt. Amor erwachen. Verliebte wählen.' No players have been set as lovers in this game. I am not in love, which means there are no alliances to consider based on that condition. We, 
the Werewolves, are awake and strategizing.

The remaining players in the game are A, B, C, D, and E. Player D finds me suspicious, 
which is a risk to our strategy. My potential targets for elimination tonight are Player C and Player D, whose roles remain unknown.

During the first round, Player B seemed hesitant, and Player D defended Player C during the day phase. 
These behaviors may provide insights into potential targets or strategies to sow suspicion among the Villagers.

My objective is to protect my identity as a Werewolf, ensure the safety of my ally Player E, 
and deceive the Villagers into suspecting someone other than us. 
I need to decide who to eliminate tonight while considering the potential risks and benefits of each choice. 
How should I proceed to achieve these goals?"
